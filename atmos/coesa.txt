             DEFINITION OF THE 1976 STANDARD ATMOSPHERE

The equations used are those adopted 15 October 1976 by the
United States Committee on Extension to the Standard Atmosphere (COESA),
representing 29 U.S. scientific and engineering organizations.
The values selected in 1976 are slight modifications of those adopted
in 1962. The equations and parameters used are documented in a book
entitled "U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976" published by the
U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.

The fundamental 7 layers of the atmosphere and the temperature
gradient in each is given by the following table

    H(lower)   H(upper)   dT/dH      ( H is geopotential altitude )
       0          11      -6.5
      11          20       0.0
      20          32       1.0
      32          47       2.8
      47          51       0.0
      51          71      -2.8
      71       84.852     -2.0      (84.852km geopotential=86km geometric)


These values plus the sea-level temperature of 288.15 kelvin and the
sea-level pressure of 101325 Newtons/sq.m. complete the definition. The
sea-level density becomes a derived quantity of 1.225 kg/cu.meter by use
of the perfect gas equation. It is quite straightforward to derive the 
temperatures at the boundaries from the value at sea level and the defined 
gradients. These turn out to be 288.15, 216.65, 216.65, 228.65, 270.65, 
270.65, 214.65, 186.946. The pressures at the boundaries (non-dimensionalized 
by the sea-level pressure) turn out to be 1.0, 2.233611E-1, 5.403295E-2, 
8.5666784E-3, 1.0945601E-3, 6.6063531E-4, 3.9046834E-5, 3.68501E-6. These 
are derived from the hydrostatic equation:

    delta=delta(base)*Exp(-GMR*deltah/tbase)          if tgrad=0

    delta=delta(base)*(tbase/tlocal)**(GMR/tgrad)     if tgrad<>0

where tbase and delta(base) are the temperature and pressure at the
base of a layer. deltah is the altitude minus the base altitude, tlocal
the temperature at this altitude and GMR=34.163195, the gas constant.
See the reference publication for more details. These values of pressure
at the boundaries are not printed in the reference, and I have included
the program called press.pas that I used to compute very accurate values
of these numbers.
This program produces the following results:
