INPUT GUIDE FOR PROGRAM HLP                                    \hlp\input.txt

This program first asks for the name of the input file. This must
be a file written to conform to the Langley Wire-Frame Geometry Standard.
The specifications for LaWGS are contained in NASA Technical Memorandum
85767, Feb 1985. For the purposes of this collection, the programs
wb2wgs, wd2wgs and makewgs are the most straightforward ways of creating
a configuration in this format. Once you catch on to the structure of
LaWGS, you should be able to write your own programs in your favorite
programming language that will create your networks.

Next, the program asks for three viewing angles, which correspond to
yaw, roll, and pitch. Enter values in degrees. To complete the viewing
definition, you need to specify the distance of the eye from the object.
Unless you are looking for an extreme perspective effect, give a
number that is large compared to the dimensions of the object. The
image will still be adjusted to fill the screen. If you have never
made inputs for hlp, you probably have no idea what values to give for
viewing angles. Some popular ones are 60,-60,-10 which shows the vehicle
in pretty much the same viewing position as most cutaway pictures in
magazines. Another interesting one is -45,-45,0 which shows the plane 
flying away from you.

Upon successfuly calculating the scene, the program produces a file
called hlp.plt that defines the vectors in 2-D that describe the
object. Each line in hlp.plt defines a point (x,y). Whenever there
is a blank line in the file, this means that the line to the next
point is invisible (from the old days of pen plotters, this is
called a pen-up draw). This file may be displayed directly with
gnuplot with the command

    gnuplot> plot "hlp.plt" with lines

Other plotting programs should be able to handle this data file
without too much difficulty.
