SILHOUETTE - HIDDEN LINE COMPUTER CODE WITH GENERALIZED SILHOUETTE SOLUTION

Flexibility in choosing how to display computer-generated three-dimensional
drawings has become increasingly important in recent years.  A major
consideration is the enhancement of the realism and aesthetics of the
presentation.  A polygonal representation of objects, even with hidden
lines removed, is not always desirable.  A more pleasing pictorial
representation often can be achieved by removing some of the remaining
visible lines, thus creating silhouettes (or outlines) of selected
surfaces of the object.  Additionally, it should be noted that this
silhouette feature allows warped polygons.  This means that any polygon
can be decomposed into constituent triangles.  Considering these triangles
as members of the same family will present a polygon with no interior
lines, and thus removes the restriction of flat polygons.

SILHOUETTE is a program for calligraphic drawings that can render any
subset of polygons as a silhouette with respect to itself.  The program
is flexible enough to be applicable to every class of object. SILHOUETTE
offers all possible combinations of silhouette and nonsilhouette
specifications for an arbitrary solid. Thus, it is possible to enhance
the clarity of any three-dimensional scene presented in two dimensions.
Input to the program can be line segments or polygons.  Polygons designated
with the same number will be drawn as a silhouette of those polygons.

SILHOUETTE is written in FORTRAN 77 and requires a graphics package
such as DI-3000.  The program has been implemented on a DEC VAX series
computer running VMS and used 65K of virtual memory without a
graphics package linked in.  The source code is intended to be
machine independent.  This program is available on a 5.25 inch 360K
MS-DOS format diskette (standard distribution) and is also available
on a 9-track 1600 BPI ASCII CARD IMAGE magnetic tape.
SILHOUETTE was developed in 1986 and was last updated in 1992.
